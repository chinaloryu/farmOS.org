# Nutrient

[https://github.com/farmOS/farm_nutrient]

The Nutrient module for farmOS provides the ability to store nutrient
management plans in farmOS. You can link it to specific [areas], and upload
your planning documents, spreadsheets, and other files for easy reference.

Development of this module was sponsored by the
[Vermont Vegetable and Berry Growers Association] and the
[University of Vermont Extension].

In the future, more nutrient management planning features may be built in this
module, including integrated calculations and input recommendations. See the
module's GitHub project page to suggest features or take part in the
development.
